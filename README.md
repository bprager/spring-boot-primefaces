SpringBoot/PrimeFaces Maven-Archetype

This is a Maven archetype which creates a simple JSF 2.0 PrimeFaces 5.2 project on top of Spring-Boot.

If you are a little familiar with PrimeFaces, this is IMHO one of the fastest ways to leverage the power of Spring-Boot and the rich UI capabilities of PrimeFaces to bring up a website.
